# To conduct survival analysis on carcinogenicity based on different tumor onset rates, competing risks survival rates, and tumor lethality rates.
#	To validated poly-k adjusted test through Monte Carlo simulation.
#	Generated data sets with Weibull tumor onset distribution.
#	Access the size and the power of the test.
# 10-fold cross validation, leave one out cross validation, bagging, confusion matrix,and bootstrap were applied.
